      <h2>Method to make a great BBQ</h2>
 <p>1)Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Halving any larger ones, cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until just tender, then drain and cool slightly.</p>
 <p>2)Meanwhile, finely grate the garlic cloves and lemon zest, mix with the harissa, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the yoghurt, a good squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.</p>
 <p>3)Peel the onion, cut into wedges, then separate into petals. Cut the chicken thighs into quarters. Toss the chicken, onions and potatoes in the dressing, thread onto 4 skewers and place on a baking tray.</p>
 <p>)Bake for 40 minutes, or until gnarly and cooked through, turning and basting halfway.<p>
 <p>5)Finely shred the lettuce. Drizzle the skewers with a little extra virgin olive oil and serve with the lettuce, remaining yogurt and lemon wedges for squeezing over. Great served in a warm flatbread too, if you like.</p>
